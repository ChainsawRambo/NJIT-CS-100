#6 1-1a. = If you leave out one parenthesis, Python thinks that you are adding more things to print.  If you forget both, you get a Syntax Error.
#6 1-1b. = Before you even get the chance to print a string without both quotation marks, you get a Syntax Error before you can even declare it as a variable.
#6 1-1c. = I tested putting a plus sign in front of the number 2, printed the variable containing it and the result still was a positive 2 with no issues.  As for 2++2, a similar result occurred were 2+2 still equaled 4 despite the extra addition sign.
#6 1-1d. = You get a Syntax Error for invalid token
#6 1-1e. = If you have two values next to each other without an operator, python will read it as one value.  However, If you put a value and value with a space in between them, you get a Syntax Error.

#6 1.2c. = 412.482 seconds for every mile or 6.874700000000002 minutes for every mile.  0.11457833333333335 hours for every mile.

#pg.15
#6 2.1a. = No
#6 2.1b. = Yes because once I asked to print x and y for x=y=1, both x and y were valued at 1.
#6 2.1c. = Nothing happened when I used the ; symbol at the end of a statement.
#6 2.1d. = It acted as a part of the value.  I put r=2. and it printed out 2.0
#6 2.1e. = I get and error that says xy is not defined.
#6 2.2a. =  Approximately 523.3333333333334 because I used 3.14 as pi since we never went over how to implement pi into python.

#6 2.2b. = $62.22 is discount only applies to base price of book and not entire order.

#6 2.2c. = 6:52 + 8 minutes + 30 minutes + 6 seconds would have you getting home at 7:30am, but technically 7:30:06am.
